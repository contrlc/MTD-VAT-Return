# MTD-VAT-Return
This sofware is NOT an accounting package and will not calculate a VAT return (either Standard or flatrate). The software consists of three parts:
1. Excel file consisting of a single MTD sheet. The MTD sheet represents a VAT return and is added to an existing spreadsheet containing VAT workings. The VAT return cells on the MTD sheet are mapped to the VAT workings in the existing accounts spreadsheet. When the user is satisfied that the values in the MTD sheet are correct, the VAT return will be sent electronically to HMRC's website by simply pressing the "Submit Return" button.
2. Excel VBA macro source for the submit button on the MTD sheet
3. Python v3 script that is invoked from the VBA macro to make the VAT sbmission to HMRC

What is missing is the credentials.txt file - this file should contain three pieces of imformation that is generated by HMRC when you create an account, namely: client_id, client_secret and server_token.
