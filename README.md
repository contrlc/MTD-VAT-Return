# MTD-VAT-Return
This sofware is NOT an accounting package and will not calculate a VAT return (either Standard or flatrate). The software consists of three parts:
1. excel template consisting of a single MTD sheet. The MTD sheet represents a VAT return and is added to an existing accounts package. The VAT return cells on the MTD sheet are mapped to the VAT workings in the existing accounts spreadsheet, and when the user is happy that the values are correct, then by prssing the submit button, the VAT return will be sent electronically to HMRC's website.
2. VBA macro source for the submit button on the MTD sheet
3. Python 3 script that is called by the VBA macro to make the VAT sbmission to HMRC

What is missing is the credentials.txt file - this file should contain three pieces of imformation that is generated by HMRC when you create an account, namely: client_id, client_secret and server_token
